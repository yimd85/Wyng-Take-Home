An age gate landing page plugin thatmeets the following criteria:
Month / Year Birthday Selector
• Success / FailMessage
• If user is 21 or older, show “welcome” success message.
• If user is under the age of 21, show an error message.
• A “remember me” check box that allows a successful user to return to the page and bypass the age gate.
Bonus:
• Upgrade the selector to include Monday /Day / Year.
• Build this plugin to allow the code to be adjusted to easily account for any age requirement.
