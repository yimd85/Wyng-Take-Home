An age gate landing page plugin thatmeets the following criteria:
* Month / Year Birthday Selector
* Success / FailMessage 
* If user is 21 or older, show “welcome” success message.
* If user is under the age of 21, show an error message.
* A “remember me” check box that allows a successful user to return to the page and bypass the age gate.
* Upgrade the selector to include Monday /Day / Year. (bonus)
* Build this plugin to allow the code to be adjusted to easily account for any age requirement. (bonus)
